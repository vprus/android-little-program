# Anroid Little Program: Facebook Login

This branch of the little program implements minimal Facebook login functionality. To try it,
you'd need to create a new Facebook application, at https://developers.facebook.com/quickstarts/?platform=android

- You'll likely need to change package name
- You will definitely need to provide your own certificate fingerprint
- Along the way, you'll be informed of the Facebook app id. Modify strings.xml accordingly.
- You can ignore other instructions to modify application code.
